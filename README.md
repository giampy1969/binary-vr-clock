# binary-vr-clock
Binary virtual reality clock

Just type bvrclock at the command line to create and start this binary virtual reality clock.

The function opens a window in a virtual world, where 6 columns of appearing and disappearing golden balls are used to display the binary-coded sexagesimal time. 
Additional explanation is available in the function help as well as here:

Besides the (subjective) coolness factor, this function might be a good example on how to interact with a vrml 
file and on how to use timers and persistent variables. Finally it might be useful in acquiring and maintaining 
a practical knowledge of binary numeration.
