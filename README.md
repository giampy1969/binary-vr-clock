Binary virtual reality clock

Note: this should work on all versions with java machine until 23a. 
I'll revise it at some point to make sure it works for later versions.

Just type bvrclock at the command line to create and start this binary virtual reality clock.

The function opens a window in a virtual world, where 6 columns of appearing and disappearing golden balls are used to display the binary-coded sexagesimal time. 
Additional explanation is available in the function help as well as here:

Besides the (subjective) coolness factor, this function might be a good example on how to interact with a vrml 
file and on how to use timers and persistent variables. Finally it might be useful in acquiring and maintaining 
a practical knowledge of binary numeration.
